All mentors must sign to agree to our child protection policy.

## Code of Conduct

* All children, parents and volunteers are treated with respect and courtesy; exclusion, bullying, disrespect or abuse will not be tolerated.
* Mentors, participants or parents noticing anything wrong or with any concerns should report them to the Duty Mentor who will take appropriate action.

## Registration

* All bookings must be made through Eventbrite (see [Registration]({{ base_path }}/registration/)) and each arriving participant will be signed into the venue from the booking list.
* Each parent or participant must complete the [Membership Form]({{ base_path }}/registration#membership-form/), including emergency contact details and any known illnesses, allergies or special requirements. The Duty Mentor will be made aware of these details each week.

## Supervision

* Prewired is attended by mentors from local universities, companies and community groups. A majority of mentors hold Disclosure.
* Prewired session activities are confined to a single open space and no child will be unsupervised at any time.
* Parents must accompany children under 11 years old.
* New attendees are met and welcomed by a mentor who will help them to get started on a project that interests them.
* All attendees are made aware of how mentors may be identified.
* Younger children wishing to use the toilets must be accompanied by their parent or responsible adult.
* Where children are not accompanied by a parent, any problems involving coding (e.g., being unwell or upset) are dealt with by the Duty Mentor.
* Mentors will monitor the activities of children working independently to ensure they are not accessing inappropriate online content.
* At least two mentors will remain at the venue until all children have been collected by guardians or left to go home at the end of the session.

## Mentors

* Interested volunteers must [contact Prewired organisers]({{ base_path }}/contact/) before attending their first session and introduce themselves to the Duty Mentor on arrival. 
* Mentors must be registered in our database. 
* Mentors must be identifiable to parents and children by wearing a mentor lanyard or T-shirt.
* The Duty Mentor is nominated for each session and must hold Disclosure.

## Communications

* The Prewired Facebook page are only open to participants, parents and active mentors. The Facebook page is moderated. <!-- The Facebook page and Google Group are moderated, and the IRC channel is password-protected. -->
* Mentors are instructed not to communicate with participants in private email messages or any other form of private medium, and must only use the public/moderated communications mechanisms above.

## Snacks

* Snacks provided at each session may include crisps, biscuits, fruit, nuts and fruit juice. There will be no fizzy/sugary drinks, energy drinks, alcohol or sweets. Mentors are instructed to not share food with participants which has not been provided by Prewired.
