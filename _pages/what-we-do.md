<!-- If you're less than 19 years old and interested in learning to code, or already know how and want to go even further, you've come to the right place!
Whether you know everything or nothing at all, all you need is to be excited about making something cool with computers. If you have ideas about what you'd like to do but don't know how to do it you should let someone know!

## How to Attend

1. [Register]({{ base_path}}/registration) for membership (it's free!), leaving your emergency contact details and any special requirements, then book your place each week for our sessions using [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/prewired-registration-15338031465). -->

Prewired is largely unstructured and our main goal is to support you in learning whatever it is you want to learn. At present we have young people working with:

* Python basics
* Python games
* Front-end web development (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
* Scratch
* Minecraft mods
* C++
* Java
* Lego Mindstorms
* Raspberry Pi
* Arduinos

From time to time we hold more structured workshops about a specific topic, and encourage all of the young people to get involved and learn something they might not otherwise have thought about.
