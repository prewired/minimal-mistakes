### Work experience

Most schools require that pupils do one or two weeks of work experience at some point. We're working with local tech companies so that young coders and computing enthusiasts can do something that is really beneficial to them.

#### Pupils...

If you have work experience coming up, and want us to help to find you a technical placement, email hello [at] prewired.org and tell us which school you go to, and the dates of your work experience.

#### Companies...

If you're a company and would like to be added to our list of awesome places that will give young people a chance to find out what working in the tech industry is really like, get in touch!

So far, these companies have said they might be able to offer a placement to young people. They can't guarantee it, but they can consider it. If you're interested in doing a placement at one of these, get in touch with Prewired and we'll put you (or your school) in contact with the right person.
