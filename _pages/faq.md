#### Why do we do this?

Many schools do not yet offer appropriate computing classes, and curricula that do exist can be patchy. The technology industry is an ever growing one, and at the moment there are more software engineering (and similar) jobs in world than there are people qualified to fill them. It would be terrible if gifted and enthusiastic young people were deterred from pursuing computing qualifications and roles because they were never aware of the opportunities available, and it's too important and urgent to wait for schools to catch up.

But learning to code doesn't only qualify you to be a coder. As our world becomes increasingly technologically-oriented, understanding the process of creating the software that powers our daily lives becomes crucial for everyone. Becoming an empowered digital citizen - or professional in another industry - allows people navigate their rights and responsibilities and make informed decisions about the products and services they use, or provide to others.

We think technology can help us towards a better world, but only if future generations understand the opportunities it brings and the impact it can have.

#### How is Prewired organised / structured

Prewired is a loose-knit group run by volunteers with no budget. There is a core group of primary organisers (Amy Guy, Ewan Klein and Freda O'Byrne), and a broader organising committee (organisers, plus Eder Coelho Paula, Stuart Roebuck, Rikki Guy and Martha Gilmore) who meet monthly and take decisions together.

We're in the process of becoming an SCIO with a board. If you're interested in talking to us about this, or getting involved with the organisation process, please get in touch!
