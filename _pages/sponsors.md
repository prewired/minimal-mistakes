### Sponsors

Prewired is run by volunteers on a shoestring budget. Keeping young people enthused about programming is [really important](faq.html#why-do-we-do-this), so if you'd like to help us keep going, read on to find out what we need.

Please email hello[at]prewired.org (or talk to Amy, Rikki or Ewan at TMU Edinburgh - they'll mention Prewired in their intros) if you or the company you work for might be able to help us out with any of the following...

Also, please make sure you're happy with our [sponsors policy](#sponsors-policy) before you agree to donate anything.

#### Equipment

Not all of the young people who come to Prewired can bring their own laptops. We have a few donated spares that attendees can borrow. Does your company have spare or old laptops lying around that could use a good home? Or could you buy us some cheap ones we can put Ubuntu on?

#### Catering

Every session we provide juice and light snacks for our attendees to keep them going and let them have a break. Currently volunteers take turns at buying these.

For certain special events and hackathons we'd like to provide light lunch daily.

* £60 per month can cover our snacks overhead.
* £150 can provide light lunch and snacks for 20 kids for one day of a special event.

#### Expertise

If you're a company with employees to spare on Wednesday evenings, send them along to CodeBase mentor!

#### Transport

Annually we take part in [Young Rewired State](http://www.festivalofco.de), which culminates in a gathering of hundreds of young people at one location in the UK. Depending on where, a coach can cost between £400 and £1000 for the whole group, and we don't want any kids to miss out because they can cover their share.

#### Prizes

Sometime we hold special hackathons, usually in the Easter Holidays, and we want to give out small prizes for the projects the young people work on. Nothing expensive, just a token of appreciation. Programming books? A fancy gaming mouse? Geeky tshirts? Suggestions and contributions are very welcome!

#### Work Experience

Many of our young people are at secondary school and have mandatory work experience coming up. These usually last one week. Some of the placements can be pretty rubbish. We think it would be really beneficial to be able to send them to a software company rather than something they're not really interested in. Can your company host an enthusiastic young coder for a week in spring/summer? We're building up a database so that we can pair young people with good placements when the time comes.

### Sponsors policy

Prewired is an independent, non-political organisation. Views of organisers, mentors and participants are our own and will be neither directed nor constrained by our sponsors. Our sponsors do not and will not influence how Prewired runs as an organisation and have no hand in its management.

We are not under any obligation to endorse any of the products or services of our sponsors. Where our mentors make recommendations, they are based on merit alone.

We wish to support independant thinking of our participants, and will not support advertising targeted at them. We refrain from asking for or handing out branded merchandise or marketing material from any of our sponsors, except where products are of particular use or benefit to participants. We hope that sponsors choose to support us for the benefit of the participants and the positive impact our activities may have on their future, rather than for personal, organisational or commercial gain.

We continue to be grateful for any support we have been given, financially or in-kind. Without this we couldn't sustain our offerings or aim to grow in the future.
