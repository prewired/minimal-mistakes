### Inventory

We encourage Prewired participants to bring their own equipment, but not everyone can. We try to keep things on hand for those who need them. This page details what we have, and what we'd like, and what we particularly need. We are *extremely* grateful to individuals and local companies who have kindly donated old equipment to us!

If you'd like to donate or lend something to us, email hello@prewired.org, or drop by CodeBase events space on a Wednesday evening!

#### We need (with some urgency)

* 3 chargers [cameron to add details]
* 2 hard drives (1 IDE, one SATA)
* one IDE drive adapter caddy
* one SATA caddy
* HDMI or DVI monitors (for use with Raspberry Pis)
* Spare keyboards and mice (for use with Raspberry Pis)

#### We'd also like

* More spare laptops and power supplies - old and clunky are perfectly fine! At a minimum should be able to run a web browser and a text editor. Able to run Netbeans, Minecraft and Unity are a plus!
* Hard drives for kids to be able to backup/store their work.
* Webhosting, accessible by individual kids over FTP for them to experiment with web development.
* More tables and chairs for the CodeBase events space.
