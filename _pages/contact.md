## When and where is Prewired?

We run sessions 5.30&ndash;7.30 pm, every Wednesday during school term time.

Sessions are held at [CodeBase](http://thisiscodebase.com), 38 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh EH3 9DZ (see [map](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/CodeBase/@55.946414,-3.200923,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5727e05b4321b9f6?sa=X&ei=wNayVLb3KsLP7QbmmYGIBA&ved=0CHQQ_BIwDg)). There is some metered parking nearby, but no free parking.

## Get in Touch

You can contact the organisers by emailing hello[AT]prewired.org.

You can also send [@prewired](http://twitter.com/prewired) a message on Twitter; the Twitter account is run by volunteer participants.

## Community

Participants and mentors can request to join the [Prewired Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/prewired).

<!-- We also have an IRC channel (server: irc.imaginarynet.uk, channel: #prewired); you'll need to ask a mentor for the password. -->

## Mentors

Memtors can ask for an invite to the `#mentors` channel on the [Slack](https://slack.com) Prewired team &mdash; this is where we post announcements, etc that might interest mentors and occasional reminders about sessions. Mentors also use this channel to chat to other mentors and ask questions.
