## Duty Mentor guidelines and rota

We hope that everyone who has undergone Disclosure is happy to be on the rota for Duty Mentor, but if you'd really rather not be, just us know. We generate the rota two weeks in advance, so please let us know immediately if you're not going to be here that week so we can replace you. We'll remind you by email, too.

It's really no big deal, and it's a huge help to us if you take a turn. Here's what you need to do:

1. Arrive at the venue at least 10 minutes in advance.
2. Don the 'Duty Mentor' lanyard or funny hat and make yourself obvious.
3. Make sure you have the attendees list, which consists of Eventbrite signups and long-term members. Read the details to make yourself aware of any serious allergies or medical conditions amongst kids present that evening. Kids should have nametags on, so don't worry if you don't know them. Put the list somewhere you can remember for the duration of the evening.
4. Greet kids and parents as they arrive, focusing on ones who look new (or ask if they've been before); invite them to choose somewhere to sit and make themselves at home. Make sure they have their own laptop or know where to find the Prewired ones if not.
5. For new attendees or those looking a bit lost, ask what they're working on. Make suggestions or refer them to another mentor if you're busy.
6. Generally oversee things. Rather than focusing on one participant, check on all of them and find mentors for those who need help.
7. Greet new mentors and explain how we work. Note their name and email address, and have them sign a printed copy of the child protection policy (should be in the folder in the cupboard). You can suggest they read the [mentors guidelines]({{ base_path }}/mentors#mentors-guidelines/), and invite them to join the Slack team. Give them a lanyard or a T-shirt (remind them to return it).
8. Escort kids to the bathroom. Don't go in; wait outside the door for them.
9. At the end of the session, thank kids and parents as they're leaving and remind them to come back next week!
10. Take any feedback from kids and parents to report back to organising committee.
